"""Format a checker verdict JSON file as a developer-friendly Markdown comment.

The sticky PR comment is the harness's developer-facing surface. The
renderer translates the verdict JSON (structural, harness-internal)
into prose a developer reading a PR can act on without learning
harness vocabulary.

Three render shapes:

- **Clean** — workflow checks passed. Headline + scope + collapsed
  audit detail. 2-3 visible lines.
- **Action required** — at least one blocking predicate failed.
  Headline names how many records need action; per-record action
  blocks tell the developer what to do, why, and how. Audit detail
  collapsed below.
- **No Work Records** — the PR didn't touch any task file under
  ``.agent-workflow/tasks/``. One-line note.

Multi-record consolidation: when ≥2 records fail the same blocking
predicate with the same fix, the action block appears once with the
affected-records list. Different fixes stay per-record.

Skip-summarisation: within a group, when ALL checks are
``passed=True`` and ``detail`` starts with ``skipped —`` (i.e. the
whole group was short-circuited by an upstream blocker), the group
renders as one summary line instead of one row per check.

Jargon translation: harness terms (``predicate``, ``marker block``,
``Verification Record``, ``satisfy by:``, ``red zone``) are
translated to plain prose at render time. The audit ``<details>`` is
the only place dotted predicate names appear, and even there they are
grouped under plain-English headings.
