description: Use when reading, updating, or reorganizing roadmap state in a repo that uses the minimap file convention. Apply for roadmap planning and status changes; do not use for general engineering workflow unless the task is specifically about roadmap files.

# Minimap

## Intent

Use the minimap roadmap files as the canonical source of planning truth for the repo.

The UI is only a human-friendly lens over those files. Agents and humans must operate on the same file state.

For the exact roadmap contract and package boundary, read `CONTRACT.md` in the same minimap package.

## Discovery

1. Check for `roadmap.config.json` at the repo root.
2. If it exists, read `roadmapPath` and resolve it relative to the repo root.
3. If it does not exist, use `roadmap/`.
4. Do not guess alternate paths when the configured location is missing.

## Ownership Rules

Within the resolved roadmap root:

- `board.md` owns group names and item order
- `scope.md` owns the current-focus narrative
- `features/*.md` owns detailed committed or active work
- `ideas/*.md` owns detailed uncommitted or parked ideas

Do not create parallel roadmap trackers outside this structure unless the user explicitly asks for them.

## Item Rules

Each roadmap item is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter.

Required frontmatter keys:
- `id`
- `title`
- `status`
- `priority`
- `commitment`

Expected body sections:
- `Summary`
- `Why`
- `In Scope`
- `Out of Scope`
- `Done When`
- `Notes`

When editing items:
- change status, priority, commitment, and title in frontmatter, not only in prose
- preserve unknown frontmatter keys if they already exist
- preserve unknown markdown sections if they already exist
- keep `id` stable unless the user explicitly asks to rename the item and all references

## Board Rules

`board.md` uses this shape:

```md
# Now
- feature-a
- feature-b

# Next
- feature-c

# Ideas
- idea-a
```

Rules:
- headings are freeform board groups chosen by the repo
- repos can group by status, release, milestone, stream, team, or any other planning model
- `Now`, `Next`, and `Ideas` are examples, not required semantics
- bullet order is canonical display order within each group
- bullet values are canonical item ids
- titles and badges come from item files, not from `board.md`
- update `board.md` only when grouping or ordering changes

## Scope Rules

Use `scope.md` for short current-focus narrative and near-term direction.

Do not put item status changes only in `scope.md`. Item state still belongs in the item files.

## Constraints

- no UI-only roadmap state
- no separate database or sync source
- no hidden agent notes inside roadmap items unless the user explicitly wants that pattern
- do not move items between `features/` and `ideas/` unless the user asks for that semantic change
- if a file is malformed, prefer surfacing the problem over rewriting it blindly

## Recommended Agent Behavior

When a roadmap task is requested:
1. Read the relevant roadmap files first.
2. Change the smallest set of files that actually own the requested truth.
3. If group/order changes, update `board.md`.
4. If focus narrative changes, update `scope.md`.
5. If item state changes, update the item file frontmatter and relevant sections.
6. Keep wording concrete and easy for both humans and agents to follow.
