<!-- A `**Label:**` at the start of a line inside this block is parsed as a field
     header; an unexpected one (unknown or duplicate) fails the record. Keep bold
     sub-headings out of a field's prose value (put such structure below the block,
     or use plain text). -->
**Outcome:**
<!-- what should be true when complete -->

**Target:**
<!-- affected system, service, or repository -->

**Scope:**
<!-- what may change -->

**Constraints:**
<!-- what must not change or must remain true; "—" if none -->

**Completion criteria:**
<!-- observable outcomes that demonstrate success; one line is fine for routine -->

**Requirement baseline:**
<!-- Before discovery, copy exact Task Context values into this JSON object. Use an authoritative source reference when available. -->
{"source":"work-record-initial","outcome":"...","scope":"...","constraints":"...","completion_criteria":"..."}

**Risk:** Routine
<!-- Routine | Elevated | High. Routine is required for this compact shape; anything else demands the expanded shape. -->

**Complexity:** Simple
<!-- Simple | Moderate | Large. Simple is required for this compact shape; anything else demands the expanded shape. -->

**Reason:**
<!-- One-line justification of the (Risk, Complexity) decision. Required when Risk or Complexity is not the default (Routine, Simple) — but you would not be using this template then. Optional for (Routine, Simple); use "—" or omit content. -->

**Approach:**
<!-- one or two lines on how -->

**Verification:**
<!-- the test(s) and CI job(s) that prove it -->

<!-- Ready to implement | Blocked | Ready for review -->
**State:** Ready to implement
