# bootstrap-mode

Active when the developer asks you to set up agent-redline for a repo. Conversational, not silent.

## Output

**Committed directly:**
- `agent-redline-policy.yaml`
- Reference section appended to the existing agent-instruction file (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `copilot-instructions.md`, or a fresh `AGENTS.md` if none exists)
- Boundary-rule backend artifacts — *only if no existing setup is found*; otherwise the policy's `boundaries:` mirror the existing rules and the existing test stays authoritative
- `scripts/agent-redline-check.sh` — standalone if no pre-push hook exists; otherwise instructions for the developer to chain
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` additions
- Per-checkpoint docs in `docs/agent/`

**Proposed, NOT committed:**
- `docs/agent-redline-ci-proposal.md` — workflow YAML, branch-protection changes, CODEOWNERS additions

## Phases

Each phase ends with a developer review or confirmation. Do not skip ahead.

1. Inspect and pick an extension
2. Extension-driven proposal
3. Adapt
4. Write
5. Propose CI
6. Self-summary

## Phase 1 — Inspect and pick an extension

Read what's in the repo:
- Build files (`build.gradle`, `pom.xml`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`)
- Source layout. For Python: `src/<pkg>/` vs flat `<pkg>/` vs multi-package (multiple top-level `__init__.py` dirs, none matching the project name). For Django: `manage.py` at root.
- JVM dependency signals (when `build.gradle` / `build.gradle.kts` / `pom.xml` present): grep for `spring-boot-starter`, `org.springframework.boot`, `jakarta.ws.rs`, `javalin`, `ktor`, `helidon`, `dropwizard`, `org.eclipse.jetty`, `com.android`, `apache.spark`, `apache.beam`, `apache.flink`, `apache.hadoop`. Determines layered-service vs library vs zone-only.
- Existing agent-instruction file: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `copilot-instructions.md`, or any `*-instructions.md` at repo root
- Existing CI (`.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`) — note the trigger (`pull_request:` vs `push:`)
- **YAML-formatting gate:** does the build lint/format `*.yaml`? Check for a `spotless {}` block, `isSpotlessEnabled = true`, or a shared Gradle plugin that wires Spotless (jackson-YAML step), plus `.editorconfig`/`.yamllint`/`.spotlessignore`. If the build formats YAML, `agent-redline-policy.yaml` is subject to it — Spotless's jackson-YAML formatter strips `#` comments and quotes bare scalars, so a policy with comments or unquoted scalars fails `./gradlew build`. Phase 4 must generate the policy in the formatter's canonical style.
- Recent flow signal: `gh pr list --state merged --limit 30 --json number` count vs `git log --since="3 months ago" --pretty=format:%h | wc -l`. Compare to gauge dominant flow (PR-driven vs push-driven)
- Existing CODEOWNERS
- Existing **boundary-rule backend setup**:
  - JVM/Spring: ArchUnit test classes (search `src/test/**` for files importing `com.tngtech.archunit`).
  - Python: `[tool.importlinter]` in `pyproject.toml`, `.importlinter`, or `[importlinter]` in `setup.cfg`.
  Treat existing rules as authoritative.
- Existing `pre-push` hook (`.git/hooks/pre-push`) or pre-push script (`scripts/pre-push*`)
- OpenAPI / GraphQL / proto files; SpringDoc plugin; FastAPI committed `openapi.json`
- DB migration directories (`db/migration/**`, `**/alembic/versions/**`, `**/migrations/**`)
- Security/auth code locations

Propose a language extension:
- JVM (Java, Kotlin) — Gradle or Maven → `jvm-archunit` — see "JVM shape selection" below
- Python (web service, library, or pipeline) → `python` — see "Python shape selection" below
- Node / JavaScript / TypeScript → `node` when a tracked `package.json` exists; see "Node shape selection" below
- Other stacks → see the upstream agent-redline EXTENSIONS docs (`docs/EXTENSIONS.md`; not vendored in our copy — upstream reference only); ask developer to pick a third-party one or proceed without one
- No extension available → offer zone-only governance (no boundary backend)

Don't modify anything yet. Produce a written summary; wait for developer confirmation. The summary must include:
- Whether an existing arch test or import-linter config was found, and if so its rules — Phase 4 composes with it, doesn't replace it
- Which agent-instruction file exists (if any) — Phase 4 adds a reference section there, not a fresh `AGENTS.md`
- Whether an existing pre-push hook exists — Phase 4 chains, doesn't replace
- Whether the build formats YAML (Spotless/jackson-YAML or similar) — if so, Phase 4 emits the policy in canonical style (no comments, quoted scalars) and the AGENTS.md section documents the constraint

### Python shape selection

`python` covers three shapes — `profile.md` enumerates them in detail. Quick triage:

| Signal | Shape |
|---|---|
| `manage.py` at root + `django` in deps | layered service + Django addendum |
| Any web framework dep (fastapi/flask/starlette/aiohttp/etc.), or layer dirs (`domain/`, `adapters/`, `infrastructure/`, `core/`, `services/`, `usecases/`, `ports/`) | layered service |
| `pyproject.toml` `[project]`, no web dep, package with `__init__.py` re-exports | library / package |
| `airflow`/`prefect`/`dagster`/`luigi` deps, or `dags/` / `pipelines/` / `notebooks/` | zone-only fallback |
| None match | zone-only fallback |

Confirm before loading `profile.md` details. If two shapes could fire, present both. Layout (src-layout / flat / multi-package) is bootstrap-derived, not a separate shape.

### JVM shape selection

`jvm-archunit` covers three shapes plus a Spring addendum — `profile.md` enumerates them. Quick triage:

| Signal | Shape |
|---|---|
| `spring-boot-starter-*` or `org.springframework.boot:*` in `build.gradle` / `pom.xml` | layered service + Spring addendum |
| Web framework dep (`jakarta.ws.rs`, `javalin`, `ktor`, `helidon`, `dropwizard`, `jetty`) or layer dirs (`controller/`, `domain/`, `application/`, `adapter/`, `infrastructure/`, `core/`, `port/`) | layered service |
| `maven-publish` / `nexus-publish` / `org.gradle.api.publish` artifact, `module-info.java` present, no web framework | library / SDK |
| `com.android.{application,library}`, Spark / Beam / Flink / Hadoop deps | zone-only fallback |
| None match | zone-only fallback |

Confirm before loading `profile.md` details. If two shapes could fire (e.g., a Spring Boot library), present both. Layout (single-module / multi-module / mixed Java+Kotlin) is bootstrap-derived, not a separate shape.

### Node shape selection

Use the Node extension when a tracked root, nested package, or workspace `package.json` is an owned project manifest; package scripts referenced by CI also show ownership. Ignore vendored, generated, and test-fixture copies for selection. If Node and another build ecosystem both have positive signals, show both and ask which profile to use. Without an owned manifest, keep the existing extension fallback. Tracked copies still retain normal risk classification. The profile supplies zones only; `boundaryAdapter.outputFormat` is `none`.

### Flow mode (CI shape)

Pick one. Affects Phase 5's CI proposal — not the policy, not the skill discipline.

| Signal | Flow mode |
|---|---|
| Existing workflow has `on: pull_request:`, multiple recent merged PRs, multiple committers | PR-driven |
| Existing workflow has `on: push:`, ~zero merged PRs, dominant flow is `git push` to main | push-driven |
| Solo developer, no PRs (or PRs only for meta-changes), trunk-based | push-driven |
| Mixed (some PR work, some direct push) | dominant signal wins; ask the developer |

PR-driven proposes a workflow on `pull_request:` with a sticky comment surfacing the verdict; CI fails only on exit 2 (binding-mode hard fail). Push-driven proposes `on: push:` with the verdict in `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`; the workflow fails on `EXIT != 0` (both RED warnings and BOUNDARY_VIOLATION hard fails) so GitHub's default workflow-failure email fires for the user who triggered the run. The reporter is invoked with `--flow-mode push` so checkpoint text reads as a review obligation on the commit (no CODEOWNER / label phrasing — neither applies on a direct push). agent-redline ships as its own `.github/workflows/` file in both modes; its failure does not affect other workflows in the repo. Both reference `extensions/<name>/scaffold.md` §5 (Python) or Spring addendum §6 (jvm-archunit) for the specific YAML.

Ask the developer for confirmation before drafting the CI proposal in Phase 5.

## Phase 2 — Extension-driven proposal

Load the chosen extension's `profile.md`. Adapt its defaults to the actual repo:
- Substitute placeholder package names with the actual ones from inspection. If the repo uses `core` instead of `domain`, translate the patterns.
- **Calibrate all zones from repository evidence.** Inspect tracked paths (`git ls-files`), source layout, tests and their configuration, and representative code before proposing zones. Extension defaults are candidates, not a policy: keep only patterns that match observed paths, then narrow broad defaults such as `**/tests/**` to the actual test layout and nested paths. Propose blue zones for isolated, replaceable code and strongly tested tests when evidence supports their low blast radius; do not leave evidenced low-risk code gray by default. Split mixed paths where possible. Keep contract, architecture, governance, security, persistence, and other protected paths red; leave genuinely uncertain paths gray. Do not infer safety from missing history when layout and code provide sufficient evidence.
- **Verify each default's path or directory exists before keeping it.** Profile defaults assume common conventions (`domain/repository/`, `**/security/**`, `terraform/**`, etc.). For each red/watch/blue entry, omit it if no tracked path matches. Don't keep phantom entries "for future use" — they bloat the policy and mislead reviewers.
- Treat documentation as a blue candidate only when its scope is narrow and evidence shows low blast radius. If docs define an authoritative behavior contract, use the existing `behaviorContracts.paths` mechanism and its required verification/protection rules; do not exempt or blue-zone those paths. Proposals require developer approval and never modify the active policy during bootstrap.
- **Use the extension's PR-size thresholds verbatim.** The extension's `profile.md` has a "Default PR-size thresholds" section. Copy those numbers into the draft policy as-is. Don't invent values; the developer can adjust them in Phase 3.
- Don't fabricate. Don't add boundary rules, zones, or checkpoints the codebase doesn't justify.

Present a draft `agent-redline-policy.yaml` with terse one-line comments. Show it for review before writing.

Sketch (`...` and `[...]` are placeholders for shape, not real values):

```yaml-sketch
version: 1
project: { name: <repo-name>, extension: <extension-name> }

zones:
  red:    [...]
  blue:   [...]
  watch: [...]

boundaries: [...]
api: { type: ..., ... }
persistence: { migrationPaths: [...] }
security: { paths: [...] }
runtimeConfig: { paths: [...] }

prRules:
  maxChangedFiles: { warn: 50, fail: 100 }
  maxLinesChanged: { warn: 1000, fail: 2000 }

checkpoints:
  architecture-review: { satisfiedBy: [codeownerApproval, label: architecture-reviewed] }
  api-review: { ... }

modes:
  default: shadow
  perCheck: { boundary_violation: binding }    # rule-name sentinels: boundary_violation, report, pr_size
```

Comments terse.

## Phase 3 — Adapt

### 3a. Zone-utility check (mandatory)

Red means **different review behavior**, not "important code" (SPEC §4). A red zone that fires on a typical feature PR is alert fatigue — the team will learn to ignore it, and you've made the project worse, not better.

For each red entry in the draft policy, walk through:

1. **Does this path change in ordinary feature PRs?** Pick three recent feature PRs and ask the developer.
2. **If yes — are most of those changes truly architectural decisions?** Adding a field to an entity isn't. Renaming a domain class is. New endpoint methods are. Refactoring private methods isn't.
3. **If most are routine — downgrade.** Move the path to `watch` (still surfaced, no checkpoint) or to `blue` (autonomous). Do not leave it as red because "the code is important." Important + routine = `watch`.
4. **If the path mixes routine and structural** — try to split it. `domain/repository/*.java` (interfaces, structural) vs `domain/repository/impl/**` (often routine). The Spring profile defaults already do this where viable; do it again for repo-specific paths.
5. **Prefer semantic over path-based triggers** when both exist. The `api:` openapi-diff is precise; controller-touch isn't.

This is a **starting hypothesis**. The first 2-4 weeks of shadow mode is where the team confirms or corrects it (Phase 5 / CI proposal).

### 3b. History-based calibration (when applicable)

The tuner takes a list of changesets and reports which red/watch rules fire most often. The unit of changeset depends on the flow mode:

- **PR-driven flow:** count merged PRs via `gh pr list --state merged --limit 1 --json number`. If 30+, run the tuner with `--repo <gh-slug> --limit 30`.
- **Push-driven flow:** count commits to the long-lived branch via `git rev-list --count main`. If 30+, run with `--push-history --branch main --limit 30`. Each push range (or commit, for solo repos pushing one commit at a time) becomes one changeset.

If fewer than 30 changesets exist either way, skip 3b; note in the policy comment that calibration will complete in Window 1 of shadow mode. Otherwise ask: *"I can run the tuner against the last 30 changesets to see which red rules fire too often. Run it?"*

On approval, run agent-workflow's unified tuner (which subsumes the upstream redline tuner; the redline-only `scripts/agent-redline-tune.py` is NOT vendored in our copy): `python <install-root>/scripts/agent-workflow-tune.py --repo <slug> --limit 30`. The tuner reads only — it queries GitHub via `gh` and writes nothing into the consuming repo. Its output carries two blocks: calibration suggestions (this section) plus a CODEOWNERS proposal (used in agent-workflow's Phase 3).

Present each suggestion: path, firing rate, current zone, proposed action. Ask the developer to approve, override, or split. For approved demotions, move the path from `red` to `watch` in the draft. For overrides, add a one-line comment in the policy: `# kept red despite NN% rate: <reason>`.

Never auto-apply suggestions. Never run the tuner without confirmation.

### 3c. Repo-specific questions

Ask:
- Third-party adapter contracts that should be red?
- Customer-specific code that must not leak into shared core?
- Multi-tenant persistence with rollout-plan implications?
- Generated source directories to exclude from classification?
- Who owns architecture / API / persistence / security / ops review?
- Normal PR size for this team — adjust thresholds?
- Existing arch tests / import-linter contracts / CODEOWNERS / CI checks to compose with?

Update the draft. Show it. Get explicit sign-off before writing.

If the developer disagrees with extension defaults, the developer wins. Note overrides explicitly.

## Phase 4 — Write

Once signed off, write the committed artifacts.

**`agent-redline-policy.yaml`** — must classify the boundary-backend definition files as red (e.g., `src/test/java/**/architecture/**` for ArchUnit, `pyproject.toml` and `.importlinter` for import-linter, or wherever the existing config lives in this repo). Verify it parses against `assets/schema/agent-policy.schema.json`.

**If Phase 1 found a YAML-formatting gate** (Spotless/jackson-YAML etc.), emit the policy in the formatter's canonical style so it survives `./gradlew build`: **no `#` comments** (jackson-YAML strips them, dirtying the file), and **quote every string scalar** (`outputFormat: "none"`, `- "codeownerApproval"`, `checkpoint: "api-review"`) since the formatter quotes bare scalars. Rationale that would normally be a comment goes in the Work Record / PR instead. After writing, run `./gradlew spotlessApply` (or the repo's format task) and commit the result so CI starts clean. Optionally recommend adding `agent-redline-policy.yaml` to `.spotlessignore` in the CI proposal (proposal-only — a build change needing human sign-off) so the governance file isn't bound to the app's code formatter.

**Agent-instruction file** — if `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `copilot-instructions.md`, or a similar file already exists at the repo root, append the agent-redline reference section from `assets/templates/AGENTS.md.template` (drop the `# AGENTS.md` heading; keep the body) under a clearly-marked heading. Do NOT create a new `AGENTS.md` alongside an existing instruction file. If none exists, copy `assets/templates/AGENTS.md.template` verbatim as `AGENTS.md`. **If Phase 1 found a YAML-formatting gate,** add a line to the appended section: "`agent-redline-policy.yaml` is Spotless-managed here — no `#` comments, quote string scalars, run `./gradlew spotlessApply` after editing. Put rationale in the Work Record / PR, not YAML comments."

**Boundary-rule backend artifacts** — read the extension's `scaffold.md`.

- **Existing setup** (ArchUnit test, `[tool.importlinter]`, etc.): do NOT generate one. Translate each rule into policy `boundaries:` metadata; the existing backend still checks.
- **No setup:** generate per `scaffold.md`. Substitute the actual base package. Don't write `..domain..` if the repo uses `..core..`.

**Boundary adapter** — merge extension `adapter.yaml` into policy, or set `boundaryAdapter: { outputFormat: none }`. Never declare `boundaries:` without one.

**Suppression markers** — copy extension `suppressions.yaml` (or `assets/templates/suppressions.yaml`) to `.agent-redline/suppressions.yaml`. Add `suppressions: { useExtensionDefaults: true, exemptPaths: ["**/tests/**"] }`, except Node uses `exemptPaths: []` so protected contract tests stay guarded. Classify it red/watch, never gray. Re-bootstrap: ask; decline leaves it off.

**Vendor the reporter** — copy `scripts/agent-redline-report.py` to the consuming repo at `scripts/agent-redline-report.py`, mark executable. The pre-push script and CI workflow both invoke it.

**Vendor the policy schema** — copy `assets/schema/agent-policy.schema.json` to the consuming repo at `.agent-redline/agent-policy.schema.json`. The reporter validates the policy against it on load, and the CI workflow's "Validate agent-redline-policy.yaml against schema" step reads it from that path. Without the vendored schema the reporter degrades to no validation — the exact gap that let malformed policies pass green.

**Validate the generated policy** — before finishing Phase 4, run the policy you just wrote through the schema: `python -c "import json,yaml,jsonschema; jsonschema.validate(yaml.safe_load(open('agent-redline-policy.yaml')), json.load(open('.agent-redline/agent-policy.schema.json')))"`. If it raises, fix the policy — do not hand-wave it. This catches the shapes agents most often get wrong: `codeownerApproval` MUST be a bare string list-item (not a `codeownerApproval: <team>` mapping — approvers come from CODEOWNERS + PR reviews at CI time, never the policy); PR-size excludes go in top-level `excludes:` (there is no `prRules.excludePatterns`); `notes:` is allowed only on `persistence`, not `api`/`security`; `api.type` MUST be `none` unless a generation plugin is actually wired (see the extension's scaffold §6).

**`scripts/agent-redline-check.sh`** — copy `assets/templates/pre-push-check.sh` verbatim, mark executable. Do NOT regenerate; a hand-rolled version will drift from CI.

If a pre-push hook already exists, do NOT replace it. Chain: have it call `./scripts/agent-redline-check.sh`, or vice versa.

**PR template** — copy `assets/templates/pr-template.md` verbatim into `.github/pull_request_template.md`. If one already exists, append the agent-redline sections under a marked heading.

**Per-checkpoint docs** — copy from `references/per-checkpoint/` into `docs/agent/`. Always: `blue-zone-work.md`, `red-zone-change.md`, `gray-zone-change.md`, `boundary-violation.md`, `pr-discipline.md`. Add `api-change-checkpoint.md`, `persistence-change-checkpoint.md`, `security-change-checkpoint.md` only when the policy declares that checkpoint.

**Templates are copied, not regenerated.** Hand-rolling drifts. Consumer edits happen after copy.

## Phase 5 — Propose CI

Write `docs/agent-redline-ci-proposal.md`. Do NOT write `.github/workflows/agent-redline.yml`.

Tell the developer:

> CI integration affects every developer and may need platform-admin approval. I've written everything I'm allowed to write directly. Open `docs/agent-redline-ci-proposal.md`, review with whoever owns CI, apply when ready.

The proposal contains:
1. Proposed workflow file (ready to copy) — pick the PR-driven or push-driven shape per Phase 1's flow-mode triage
2. Required-status-check additions for branch protection (PR-driven only — solo / push-driven repos skip this)
3. CODEOWNERS additions, mapped best-effort to teams from Phase 3 (PR-driven only — push-driven repos skip)
4. **Recommended initial mode: shadow.** 4 weeks or 30 PRs of shadow before flipping anything to binding. Push-driven repos use commits (not PRs) as the calibration unit — see Phase 3b for the `--push-history` tuner mode.
5. **Boundary-backend baseline** if running the backend on `main` surfaces existing violations: capture them, fail CI for *new* violations only.
6. Decisions explicitly flagged for human judgment.

The workflow YAML invokes the standalone reporter directly. The reusable Action is roadmap; don't reference it as if it exists.

## Phase 6 — Self-summary

- What was committed (file list)
- What was proposed but not committed (the CI proposal)
- What still needs human action (apply CI proposal, set up branch protection, replace placeholder team names, run shadow mode)
- How to verify the local check works
- Where the docs live

Be honest about anything you couldn't classify cleanly.

## Hard rules

- Never auto-commit CI workflow files, branch-protection changes, or CODEOWNERS additions.
- Never overwrite an existing `agent-redline-policy.yaml` without confirmation.
- Never overwrite an existing arch test or import-linter config (or other boundary-backend definition). Compose via `boundaries:` instead.
- Never overwrite an existing agent-instruction file. Append a reference section.
- Never overwrite an existing pre-push hook. Tell the developer how to chain.
- The generated policy must classify the boundary-backend definition files as red (`architecture-review` checkpoint).
- The generated policy must classify itself (`agent-redline-policy.yaml`) as red with `architecture-review`. Without this, an agent can drop the red rule blocking its change and ship unchallenged.
- Write artifacts only after the developer signs off on the policy in Phase 3.

## When the repo doesn't fit

If inspection finds no recognizable structure to protect — no domain/adapter split, no port interfaces, no API surface, no migrations:

1. **Decline.** Tell the developer agent-redline only protects boundaries the team is willing to name. Suggest explicit modeling work first.
2. **Partial bootstrap.** Cover only the parts that *do* have structure (security paths, runtime config, migrations if any). Skip boundary rules until there's structure to enforce.

Don't fabricate architecture the codebase doesn't have.
