# scripts/agent-redline-check.sh
#
# Local mirror of the agent-redline CI check.
# Runs the reporter against the local diff (vs. the configured base branch)
# and prints the verdict.
#
# The reporter dispatches on the policy's `boundaryAdapter` block, so this
# script is stack-neutral: a Spring repo's policy declares
# outputFormat: junit-xml + outputPath: build/test-results/...; a Python
# repo's declares outputFormat: json-violations + outputPath:
# build/import-linter-report.json. Either way, this script only needs to
# know where the reporter is.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/agent-redline-check.sh                    # against origin/main
#   ./scripts/agent-redline-check.sh --base develop     # different base
#
# Notes on api.type: openapi-from-controllers
#   The CI workflow generates spec_base.yaml + spec_head.yaml at the two
#   SHAs and passes them to the reporter. This local check does NOT run
#   the generation command (running two builds during a pre-push is
#   hostile). It relies on red-zone path classification — touched
#   controllers are red and trigger api-review via the policy. CI sees
#   the structural diff; the local run sees "you touched a controller."
#   That asymmetry is by design.
